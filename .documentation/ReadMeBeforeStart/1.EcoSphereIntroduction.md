# Project Background Recap

The EcoSphere project was initiated in response to the Green Building Technology and Applied Research Centre (GBTAC) at SAIT's need for a comprehensive smart building analytics system. GBTAC is a state-of-the-art sustainable building that collects extensive data on water consumption, electricity usage, and thermal performance through various sensors and monitoring systems.

Currently, this valuable data is underutilized, with limited visualization and analysis capabilities. Building managers, researchers, and students lack an intuitive platform to explore sustainability metrics, identify optimization opportunities, and showcase the building's environmental performance.

EcoSphere aims to transform this raw data into actionable insights through an interactive web-based dashboard system. The platform will serve multiple user groups: administrators who manage the system and users, team members who analyze building performance data, and visitors who can learn about sustainable building practices through interactive quizzes.

This capstone project represents a real-world opportunity to apply software development skills to create a meaningful solution that promotes environmental awareness and supports GBTAC's mission of advancing green building technology.

# Project Description

## Purpose

The primary purpose of EcoSphere is to create an intelligent building analytics platform that transforms GBTAC's sensor data into meaningful insights. The system will enable stakeholders to monitor real-time building performance, analyze historical trends, generate predictive forecasts, and make data-driven decisions to optimize resource consumption and reduce environmental impact.

Key objectives include:

Providing real-time visualization of water, electricity, and thermal data

Enabling comparative analysis across different time periods and building zones

Generating automated reports and forecasts based on historical patterns

Facilitating educational engagement through interactive quizzes for building visitors

Supporting research activities with comprehensive data access and export capabilities

## Target Audience

Administrators: GBTAC admins with full system access to manage users, configure dashboards, create quizzes, and oversee all system operations

Team Members: Researchers, facility staff, and students (if applicable) who analyze building data, generate reports, and use AI-powered insights with role-based permissions

Visitors: Building tour participants and general public who access educational content and participate in sustainability quizzes via QR codes

## Key Features (originally planned)

Dashboard System

Electricity Reports: Generation vs. consumption, carbon footprint calculation, hotspot identification, etc.
