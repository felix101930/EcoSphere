# Project Background Recap

The EcoSphere project was initiated in response to the Green Building Technology and Applied Research Centre (GBTAC) at SAIT's need for a comprehensive smart building analytics system. GBTAC is a state-of-the-art sustainable building that collects extensive data on water consumption, electricity usage, and thermal performance through various sensors and monitoring systems.

Currently, this valuable data is underutilized, with limited visualization and analysis capabilities. Building managers, researchers, and students lack an intuitive platform to explore sustainability metrics, identify optimization opportunities, and showcase the building's environmental performance.

EcoSphere aims to transform this raw data into actionable insights through an interactive web-based dashboard system. The platform will serve multiple user groups: administrators who manage the system and users, team members who analyze building performance data, and visitors who can learn about sustainable building practices through interactive quizzes.

This capstone project represents a real-world opportunity to apply software development skills to create a meaningful solution that promotes environmental awareness and supports GBTAC's mission of advancing green building technology.

# Project Description

## Purpose

The primary purpose of EcoSphere is to create an intelligent building analytics platform that transforms GBTAC's sensor data into meaningful insights. The system will enable stakeholders to monitor real-time building performance, analyze historical trends, generate predictive forecasts, and make data-driven decisions to optimize resource consumption and reduce environmental impact.

Key objectives include:

Providing real-time visualization of water, electricity, and thermal data

Enabling comparative analysis across different time periods and building zones

Generating automated reports and forecasts based on historical patterns

Facilitating educational engagement through interactive quizzes for building visitors

# Gantt Chart Creation

The detailed Gantt chart for the EcoSphere project has been created using Microsoft Project and is submitted as a separate file (EcoSphere.mpp). The Gantt chart includes:

Over 270 detailed tasks organized in a hierarchical work breakdown structure

All tasks and subtasks with specific durations (ranging from 0.25 to 1 day)

Task dependencies showing sequential and parallel relationships

Resource assignments for all four team members (Jessica, Felix, Sanbir, Xujun)

Eight milestone markers for key project deliverables

Timeline spanning 15 weeks from January 6, 2026 (Tuesday) to April 17, 2026

Critical path highlighting to identify schedule-critical tasks

Complete alignment with PROJ 309 course milestones and deadlines

Week-by-week breakdown matching course requirements

Comprehensive coverage of all technical implementation details

The Gantt chart provides a visual representation of the project timeline and serves as a planning and tracking tool throughout the development process. It will be updated regularly to reflect actual progress and any necessary adjustments to the schedule.
